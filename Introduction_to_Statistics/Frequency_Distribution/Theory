## **Frequency Distribution: Grouped and Ungrouped**
Frequency distribution is a way of organizing data to show how often each value or range of values occurs. It is fundamental in **data analysis, statistics, and data science** because it helps to summarize large datasets, identify patterns, and visualize distributions.

### **1. Ungrouped Frequency Distribution**
An **ungrouped frequency distribution** is used when dealing with small datasets, where we list each distinct data value along with its frequency (how often it appears).

#### **Example of Ungrouped Frequency Distribution**
Consider a dataset representing the number of books read by 10 students:

| Number of Books Read | Frequency |
|---------------------|----------|
| 1                  | 2        |
| 2                  | 3        |
| 3                  | 2        |
| 4                  | 2        |
| 5                  | 1        |

Here, each value is listed individually with its corresponding count.

#### **Python Implementation (Ungrouped Frequency Distribution)**
```python
import pandas as pd

# Sample data
books_read = [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 1, 2]

# Create a frequency distribution
freq_dist = pd.Series(books_read).value_counts().sort_index()

# Display the frequency table
print("Ungrouped Frequency Distribution:")
print(freq_dist)
```

### **2. Grouped Frequency Distribution**
When dealing with large datasets, listing each value individually becomes impractical. Instead, we **group values into intervals (or classes)** and count how many fall within each interval.

#### **Example of Grouped Frequency Distribution**
Consider a dataset of studentsâ€™ marks:

| Marks Range  | Frequency |
|-------------|----------|
| 0 - 10      | 2        |
| 11 - 20     | 5        |
| 21 - 30     | 8        |
| 31 - 40     | 10       |
| 41 - 50     | 6        |

Here, marks are grouped into **intervals**, making it easier to analyze patterns.

#### **Python Implementation (Grouped Frequency Distribution)**
```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Sample dataset: marks obtained by students
marks = [5, 8, 15, 18, 22, 25, 27, 29, 33, 36, 38, 40, 42, 44, 45, 47, 50]

# Define class intervals (bins)
bins = [0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
hist, bin_edges = np.histogram(marks, bins=bins)

# Display frequency table
print("Grouped Frequency Distribution:")
for i in range(len(hist)):
    print(f"{bin_edges[i]} - {bin_edges[i+1]}: {hist[i]}")

# Plot histogram
plt.hist(marks, bins=bins, edgecolor='black')
plt.xlabel("Marks Range")
plt.ylabel("Frequency")
plt.title("Grouped Frequency Distribution of Marks")
plt.show()
```
